# Thank you for the opportunity (and time) to work on the code challenges for Grow.

## The front-end challenge is located in the `findmyrep` directory.

This will load on `yarn start` to http://localhost:3000/.

## The server is located in the `server` directory.

This will load on `yarn start` to http://127.0.0.1:3300/.
I updated the port to prevent a conflict with the default CRA-assigned port.

## Tests can be ran with `yarn test` or `npm test`

In the interest of time and transparency, I wrote tests for many components but did not achieve 100% test coverage.
